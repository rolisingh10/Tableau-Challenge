## The Analysis

  The Jan, 2023 and Jun, 2023 data was connected to the Tableau. The first visualization is a map of all the end stations in the month of Jan, 2023. The size of the bubbles is indicative of the number of riders ending their ride in that station.

  The next sheet is a barchart showing the busiest stations in the month of January. It has a filter of the types of bikes and the visualization changes accordingly. The most busy station for the month of January is GROVE ST PARK.
  The sheet 3 line chart shows the busiest time of the day in January, 2023 and it indicates that 8am in the morning and 5 pm in the evening is the most busiest part of the day. The city can provide more bikes during these time of days.
The sheet 4 shows a comparison of stations in June VS January, 2023. This sheet also has a filter in the dashboard where it changes according to the membership type. The bar charts show no significant difference in the traffic in stations in June or January, 2023.

We can see that Classic bikes are most popular as compared to other bikes.
On sheet 6, we can see that number of rides in June are more as compared to number of rides in January. It seems that weather plays a role in this, since New York gets really cold in winter.
The sheet 8 shows that there are more member riders as compared to casual riders. The New York city can give incentives to people to become members so that more peple can take advantage of this service.
